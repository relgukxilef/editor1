VAO
    Stores the name of a buffer, size, type, stride and offset for each attribute index
    
    essentially stores the mapping between data in VBOs and a program interface
    

program interface
    attribute types (doesn't care whether they are per vertex or per instance)
    uniform types
    
VAO interface
    per vertex attribute types
    per instance attribute types
    
call interface
    uniform types
    per vertex attribute types
    per instance attribute types
    
instance interface
    per vertex attribute types
    per instance attribute types
    
    
TODO: implement calls as just taking a program name and a VAO name first
