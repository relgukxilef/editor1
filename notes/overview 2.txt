objects
    ge1 has several objects that store some kind of state and frequently wrap or reference OpenGL objects. 
    
    attribute_array
        stores the offset to a member in a attribute_pack_array
        
    attribute_pack_array
        stores a reference to a vbo, a list of attribute_arrays and a stride

    vertex_array
        stores a list of attributes, their vbos, offsets and strides
        stores the number of vertices and maybe the index of the first one
        
        attribute_pack_arrays could be stored as intrusive list
        
    vertex_array_indirect_instanced
        stores pointers to a vertex_array holding the vertices, a vertex_array holding instance information and a reference to a vbo holding a command list
        
    vertex_array_indirect
        same as vertex_array_indirect but the instance count values are only allowed to be 0 or 1
        
managers
    These wrap objects to allow higher lever operations on it.
    
    dynamic_vertex_array
        allows insertion and removal of elements into a vertex_array
        
    dynamic_vertex_array_indirect
        allows insertion and removal of meshes, vertices into meshes and instances of meshes
        each instance of a mesh has its own entry in the command list
        the instance counter may only be 0 or 1 and operates as visibility flag
        
    dynamic_vertex_array_indirect_instanced
        allows insertion and removal of meshes, vertices into meshes and instances of meshes
        
        As long as attributes are never moved to different VBOs the VAO doesn't need to be updated. Therefore it's not necessary to have this class keep a VAO updated.
        
passes
    These can be inserted into a composition to trigger certain actions at specific steps in the rendering process.
    
    draw_indirect_call
        Stores a pointer to a vertex_array_indirect and renders them.
        
    draw_indirect_instanced_call
        Stores a pointer to a vertex_array_indirect_instanced and renders them.
        
    sphere_frustum_culling
        Stores pointers to one attribute_array containing model matrices, one containing radii and one containing draw commands.
        When executed it writes 1s into the instanceCount of draw commands that are visible and 0s into those that are invisible.
        
    sphere_frustum_culling_instanced
        Same as sphere_frustum_culling but produces a stream compacted array of indices to visible instances and a count of visible instances for each draw command.
